**Description:** The kinematics of bodies in spacetime. Free fall described by geodesics: trajectories that parallel transport their tangents through spacetime, and extremize the experienced proper time. How symmetries of spacetime lead to quantities being conserved along geodesics; associated notions of “energy” and “angular momentum” for certain spacetimes.

**Instructor:** Prof. Scott Hughes
